    <h2>Ingredients For HomeMade Beef Stew </h2>
    <p>This Classic Homemade Beef Stew recipe is so easy to make and so heavenly. A one-pot meal that’s hearty, flavorful and loaded with tender beef morsels, potatoes, and carrots. Cooked in a rich and savory sauce, this beef stew recipe is comfort food at its best.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds top sirloin steak, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure To Follow</h2>
   <p>Lets first talk about how we made this easy vegetable beef stew recipe.</p> 
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> While prepping everything else preheat the oven to 325° F.</li>
    <li><strong>Prep Beef:</strong> Season the beef chunks on all sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the flour over and toss the seasoned beef to coat it on all sides.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat Skillet:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. If you don’t have a dutch oven, use an oven-safe skillet/pot that has a cover.</li>
    <li><strong>Add other ingredients:</strong> Then add the onions, garlic, and carrots to the Dutch oven, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly browned. Add the potatoes, beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, and use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix and simmer:</strong>Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, and return the beef to the pot. </li>
    <li><strong>Cook in Oven:</strong> Cover the Dutch oven (pot), and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook the stew for 2-2.5 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Remove the bay leaf.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> Taste the stew and season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve warm.</li>
   </ul>
